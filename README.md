## ⏳ What is the Pomodoro Technique?

> The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. The concept is simple: work in focused intervals, followed by short breaks.

### How it works:
- 25 minutes of focused work
- 5-minute break
- After 4 sessions, take a longer break

This method trains your brain to focus, reduces burnout, and increases sustainable productivity throughout the day. It's a technique widely used by developers, writers, students, and anyone who needs to manage attention and avoid distractions.
